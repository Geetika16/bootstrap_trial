      <p class="para">Flat design is a minimalist UI design genre, or design language, commonly used in graphical user interfaces (such as Web applications
	  and Mobile app), especially in graphical materials as posters, arts, guide documents, publishing products.Flat design is a style of interface design 
	  emphasizing minimum use of stylistic elements that give the illusion of three dimensions (such as excessive use of drop shadows, gradients or textures)[1] 
	  and is focused on a minimalist use of simple elements, typography and flat colors.[2] Designers may prefer flat design because it allows interface designs
	  to be more streamlined and efficient. It is easier to quickly convey information while still looking visually appealing and approachable.[3] Additionally,
	  it makes it easier to design an interface that is responsive to changes in browser size across different devices. With minimal design elements, websites
	  are able to load faster and resize easily, and still look sharp on high-definition screens.[1] As a design approach, it is often contrasted to 
	  skeuomorphism [4] and rich design.[1] (Though it should be noted that flat design can use skeuomorphs just a much as a realistically designed UI).</p>
	  <p class="text-primary">Microsoft was one of the first to apply this design style to its interface, seen by some as a backlash against the popular skeuomorphic design that 
	  Apple kicked off with its iOS interface. Instead of converting a real-life object, such as a calendar, into a tiny realistic illustration, advocates of 
	  flat design identify apps with simple, icon-like images.Rather than bringing aspects of real life to an interface, this illustrates a clear separation 
	  between technology and tactile objects.</p>
	  <p>Flat design uses many simple user interface elements, such as buttons and icons. Designers often stick to simple shapes, such as rectangles, 
	  circles or squares and allow each shape to stand alone. Shape edges can be perfectly angular and square or include curvature.Each UI element should be
	  simple and easy to click or tap.Interaction should be intuitive for users without a lot of in-design explanation. n almost flat design, the basic theme 
	  of the flat style is used but some effects are added to the design scheme. Buttons, for example, may contain slight gradients or drop shadows. Designers 
	  typically pick one effect and use it exclusively in an almost flat project.</p>
